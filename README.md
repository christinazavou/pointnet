### This repo is forked from [charlesq34/pointnet](https://github.com/charlesq34/pointnet), which is the original implementation of PointNet.

This repo is just for my experimentation with the model. Please check the original repo for details.

Here, I implemented a more object-oriented approach of PointNet under the folder MyPointNet, based on the initial implementation, and updated initial code to use TF v2.
